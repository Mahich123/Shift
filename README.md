# What is Shift?

Shift is an open-source interpreted programming language written in [Go](https://go.dev/), currently under heavy development.

# Why Shift?

I'm developing this language for general-purpose programming with simple syntax similar to the English language, which makes programmers write programmes with fewer lines than compared to some other programming languages.

## Example

Here is a simple "hello world" program.

```py
# The print() function print the object onto the screen.
print("Hello, World!")
```
