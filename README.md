# What is Shift?

Shift is an open-source interpreted programming language written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

# Why Shift?

I'm developing this language for general-purpose programming with simple syntax similar to the English language, which makes programmers write programmes with fewer lines than compared to some other programming languages.

## Example Program

Here is a simple "hello world" program.

- Create a new file with any file extension, But `.shift` was recommended, and then enter and save the following code given below.

```py
print("Hello, World!")
```

- The `print()` function prints a message onto the screen.
- Execute the program, If everything is fine, you'll see the following message on the screen.

```
Hello, World!
```

<!-- ## Future Goals

- Make it more convenient. -->
