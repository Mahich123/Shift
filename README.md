# What is Shift?

Shift is an open-source interpreted programming language written in [Go](https://go.dev/).

# Why Shift?

I'm developing this language for general-purpose programming with simple syntax similar to the English language, which makes programmers write programmes with fewer lines than compared to some other programming languages.

## Example

Here is a simple "hello world" program.

```py
# The print() function print the object onto the screen.
print("Hello, World!")
```

<!-- ## Future Goals

- Make it more convenient. -->

## Building from source code

Install **Go** from the official [go.dev](https://go.dev/) website for your operating system.

- Clone the branch.
```
git clone https://github.com/sijey-praveen/Shift.git
```

- CD into the project
```
cd Shift
```

- Run the following command to build it
```
go build main.go
```
